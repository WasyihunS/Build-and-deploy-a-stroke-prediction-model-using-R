# stroke prediction model using R

# By Wasyihun Sema Admass

# Project Scenarion
# Challenge:

The number of stroke diagnoses is alarmingly increasing, causing immense personal and societal burdens. Our healthcare organization is determined to tackle this challenge head-on.
#Solution:
We are initiating a revolutionary project to develop a stroke prediction model. By harnessing the power of our vast patient data, including medical history and demographics, we aim to accurately predict a patient's risk of stroke.
Impact:
•	Early Intervention: This model will be a game-changer in our clinical decision-making. By identifying high-risk patients, we can provide timely preventive measures and potentially save lives.
•	Personalized Care: Monitoring high-risk patients through the model will allow us to tailor interventions and track their effectiveness, continuously improving patient outcomes.
•	Pioneering Innovation: Our success will not only benefit our patients, but also position us as a leader in healthcare AI, inspiring broader adoption of machine learning for better patient care.
# Project Objectives:
1.	Delve into Data: Through meticulous exploration, we will uncover the key patient and clinical characteristics that hold the most predictive power for stroke risk.
2.	Building a Champion: We will construct a robust and validated stroke prediction model, ensuring its accuracy and reliability for clinical use.
3.	Empowering Decisions: We will seamlessly integrate the model into our clinical workflow, equipping healthcare providers with vital insights to guide their preventive strategies.
